    <h3>Self-Introduction</h3>
    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Hello everyone, I am Zhijing Xin, an undergraduate student majoring in
        <strong>Computer Science</strong> at
        <strong>Chongqing University</strong>, and I have been successfully
        recommended for further study at the <strong>USTC</strong>. Since
        entering university, I have been focusing on the field of Computer
        Science and Technology, especially accumulating knowledge and experience
        in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this personal website to record my learning and growth
        journey, and to share my research experiences and daily life. Recently,
        I have started self-learning front-end development technologies,
        gradually mastering relevant skills through the MDN documentation and
        hands-on projects. I hope to consolidate my programming foundation by
        building simple web pages and grow together with everyone.

    <h3>Research Experience</h3>
    <div class="research-block">
      <h4>
        Artifact Product Image Defect Detection System Based on Large Vision
        Models (Core Member, Municipal Innovation Project)
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Project Content:</strong> The goal of the project is to
          improve industrial defect detection systems by using a fusion
          architecture of DINOv2 and Swin-Large, enhancing the accuracy and
          efficiency of defect identification.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Contribution:</strong> Improved the PL module,
          fine-tuned DINOv2 and Swin-T, and implemented the overall pipeline.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="research-block">
      <h4>
        Road Damage Detection System Based on Domain Fusion (Project Leader)
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Project Content:</strong> This project adopts the YOLOv5
          framework combined with the MK-MMD domain adaptation algorithm to
          solve the problems of high annotation cost and data discrepancy in
          road damage detection, successfully labeling more than 5,000
          target-domain road images.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Contribution:</strong> Designed and implemented a
          domain fusion algorithm based on MK-MMD, improving model performance.
